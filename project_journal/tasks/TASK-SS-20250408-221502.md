# Task Log: TASK-SS-20250408-221502 - API Development

**Goal:** Modify `app/libs/job_matcher/similarity_searcher.py` to remove conditional query logic based on result count (<= 5), ensuring vector similarity search is always used.

**Implementation Steps:**
*   Analyzed `similarity_searcher.py`, `matcher.py`, and `vector_matcher.py`.
*   Identified the conditional logic for fallback query (<= 5 results) within `vector_matcher.py` (lines 89-107).
*   Removed the conditional block using `apply_diff` to ensure `_execute_vector_query` is always called.

---
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Outcome:** Success
**Summary:** Modified `app/libs/job_matcher/vector_matcher.py` to remove the conditional execution path based on result count. The vector similarity query (`_execute_vector_query`) will now always be used.
**References:** [`app/libs/job_matcher/vector_matcher.py` (modified)]
