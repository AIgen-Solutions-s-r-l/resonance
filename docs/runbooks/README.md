- **Alert Description**: What the alert means
- **Severity**: Impact level
- **Impact**: Effect on users/system
- **Investigation Steps**: Diagnostic procedures with commands
- **Common Causes**: Typical root causes
- **Resolution Steps**: Immediate actions and long-term fixes
- **Escalation**: When and how to escalate

## Creating a New Runbook

Use the template in `docs/templates/runbook-template.md` to create a new runbook.

Runbooks follow the naming convention:
