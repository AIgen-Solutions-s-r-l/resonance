## About Issue Documentation

Issue documents track known problems and their workarounds. Use this directory for:

- Recurring issues that don't have permanent fixes
- Known limitations of the system
- Issues waiting for upstream fixes (dependencies, infrastructure)
- Documented workarounds for common problems

Each issue document should include:

- **Description**: What the issue is
- **Impact**: Who/what is affected
- **Workaround**: Temporary solution if available
- **Permanent Fix Plan**: Long-term resolution strategy
- **Related Documents**: Links to investigations, fixes, or ADRs
