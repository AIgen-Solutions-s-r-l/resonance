We scale projects that transform French and European societies towards the Common Good. We act in favor of the integral development of man and a freer, more just, and unified society to be a tool for the transformation of France for the benefit of all. We support initiatives around four priorities: integral education, human growth, spirituality, solidarity, family, and heritage and culture. Concretely, we study these areas to identify problems to solve or opportunities to seize. We then design solutions and look for entrepreneurs to co-create them with us!\n\nThe reality is that international rankings highlight the decline in the academic performance of French students. According to the PISA ranking managed by the OECD, which measures and ranks the effectiveness of educational systems of 85 countries each year, France has lost 14 positions in the global mathematics ranking between 2000 and 2018. The main academic success indicators have never been more positive. The proportion of students who pass the baccalaureate has been constantly increasing to reach a record of 97.5 in 2022. The mention rate, which was 32 in 2004, is now over 67 in 2023. The institutional evaluation system is often no longer taken into account for students' passage into higher education. The reputation of the high school of origin and students' motivation dossiers weigh more in the balance and decisions are made before the baccalaureate results are released.\n\nOur idea\nWe therefore want to imagine a new competence certification that is recognized and demanding to facilitate and guide student selection between secondary and higher education. The objective?\nTo enable schools to better know their students and reduce biases and inequalities.\nTo help students identify their strengths and weaknesses in each of the tested disciplines.\nTo support schools in adopting good evaluation and follow-up practices.\n\nYour role as an entrepreneur is to bring your vision, energy, and passion to deepen this idea and to collaborate with us to make it a reality.

Develop a strong brand to legitimize the use of an independent test. Develop strategic partnerships with educational organizations and communicate transparently on how the test is designed, managed, and corrected.\n3. Ensure the promotion and adoption of the test within higher education institutions. Create detailed reports for teachers and promote the test to parent communities to accelerate its deployment in institutions.\n\nYou are the right profile if\nYou have a minimum of 6 years of professional experience in demanding environments.\nYou have a clear head, the ability to look at the big picture, and to design a viable long-term strategy.\nYou enjoy getting your hands dirty, even if you are supported, you remain in control. You are not afraid to use your phone to refine your idea gradually.\nYou can manage multiple subjects at once. finance, HR, legal, real estate, you are able to quickly learn new subjects or seek out experts if needed.\nYou have a strong affinity for the education sector.\n\nWhat we offer during the incubation period (3-6 months):\n- A development-friendly work environment. A dedicated floor for entrepreneurs in our Paris 2 offices.\n- Follow-up with the Studio team. An ongoing weekly mentoring from a Studio team member and senior operating partners available on strategy, finance, marketing.\n- A network of partners and service providers available for your specific needs.

Distance traveled refers to the total number of kilometers or miles a vehicle has covered since its manufacture.

Fuel efficiency, measured in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km) or miles per gallon (MPG), indicates how much fuel the vehicle consumes to cover a specific distance.
